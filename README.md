# Age De Psych√© (Board game)

This project is a board game inspired by **Ticket to Ride**, except here players gather resources instead of building train routes. The game also includes a custom map editor, allowing users to create their own maps by adding points and linking them with resource requirements.

- **Game Modes**: Play the default game or choose from pre-built scenarios.
